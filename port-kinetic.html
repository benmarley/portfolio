<h1 class="item-title">Aldo Raine Speech</h1>
<p itemprop="about" class="info-content">I created this Kinetic Type motion graphic based on a speech given by Aldo Raine because I thought the speech was powerful and evocative with a lot of conviction. Essentially the theme of this motion piece was to create words that flowed through the speech in a way that worked with it.</p>
