				<h2 class="item-title">"Click" Motion Graphic</h2>
				<p itemprop="about" class="info-content">The objective of this project was to create a unique and quick motion graphic that used stop motion as a basis. How I approached this was by thinking about a dynamic object that has interested me my whole life which is the Rube Goldberg. Through sketching (seen in image 1-2) I was able to create the basis of a functional motion piece. Other interesting areas to this project is that I mixed digital media with physical; the digital assets can be seen in my run cycle that I developed for the poject and the arm pulling the light chord.</p>
